<p>
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Utah in 2022, followed by a one-year stint at Wells Fargo.

<p>
My research interest is mathematical data. Specifically, I work on randomized algorithms, network data analysis, and multifidelity methods. As a problem-driven researcher, I enjoy learning new ideas from all walks of life and finding connections between them. My MBTI personality type is INFP.

Note: I no longer have access to the old webpage located at <a href="https://www.math.utah.edu/~yxu/">[utah]</a>. Consequently, I won't be able to make any further updates to it.

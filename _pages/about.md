I am a fifth-year PhD student in Deparment of Mathematics, University of Utah. My advisors are [Yekaterina Epshteyn](http://www.math.utah.edu/~epshteyn/) and [Akil Narayan](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~akil/). Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in the fields of approximation theory, scientific computing, uncertainty quantification, optimization, and data science. I am currently on the job market and expect to graduate in April 2022. Here is my [CV](https://dihandai.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

See below for a video showing how the uncertainty in the shallow water system propogate as time changes. The numerical example is taken from this [poster](https://dihandai.github.io/files/ICERMPoster_Dihan-Dai.pdf).

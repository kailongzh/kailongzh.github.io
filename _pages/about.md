I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Waterloo. I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Utah in 2022, followed by a one-year stint at Wells Fargo.

My research interest is mathematical data. Specifically, I work on randomized approximation and sampling, network data analysis, and multifidelity methods. As a problem-driven researcher, I enjoy learning new ideas from all walks of life and finding connections between them. My MBTI personality type is INFP.

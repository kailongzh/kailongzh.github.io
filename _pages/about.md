Hello and welcome! 

I'm a self-motivated fourth-year PhD student at the Center for Renewable Carbon at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. My advisor is [Mi Li](https://mili.utk.edu/). My research focuses on the sustainable and innovative development of functional materials derived from cellulose.

As an independent researcher, I'm interested in understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying material performance, with expertise in chemical characterization, material synthesis, and computational chemistry. I'm proficient in X-ray scattering, morphology characterization, NMR, DFT, and molecular dynamics simulations.

I am expected to graduate in Summer 2025 and am actively seeking postdoctoral opportunities.

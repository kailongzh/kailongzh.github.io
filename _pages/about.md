Hello and welcome! 

I'm a passionate third-year PhD student at the Center for Renewable Carbon at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. My advisor is [Mi Li](https://mili.utk.edu/). My research journey is dedicated to the innovative world of functional materials, particularly those derived from cellulose biomass.

At the heart of my work is a commitment to sustainability. By exploring and designing novel materials from cellulose biomass, I aim to contribute to a greener, more sustainable future. Here is my [CV](https://kailongzh.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

See below my work overview!

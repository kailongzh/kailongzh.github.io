### [Faculty-Student Team Receives Grant to Remove ‘Forever Chemicals’ from Water](https://utianews.tennessee.edu/school-of-natural-resources-team-receives-grant-to-remove-forever-chemicals-from-water/)
April 24, 2024  
Assistant professor Mi Li has built a student team to work on EPA project including Kailong Zhang, a Ph.D. student in the School of Natural Resources, and Ryan Baskette, an undergraduate student in the Department of Biochemistry and Cellular and Molecular Biology. The team received a $_75,000 research grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for a two-year project using a cellulose-functionalized adsorbent to remove per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from water. The grant comes from the EPA’s People, Prosperity, and the Planet Program, which provided almost $_1.2 million to 16 college student teams across the U.S. to develop solutions for environmental and public health challenges. The team plans to create a cellulose-metal organic frameworks (Cello-MOFs) hybrid adsorbent to remove PFAS from water.

### [Graduate student Kailong Zhang wins Student Faculty Research Award](https://crc.tennessee.edu/asst-prof-mi-li-and-graduate-student-kailong-zhang-win-student-faculty-research-award/)
Dec 04, 2023  
PhD student Kailong Zhang and Assistant Professor Mi Li at the Center for Renewable Carbon and the School of Natural Resources recently were awarded a Fall 2023 Student Faculty Research Award (SFRA). They will receive funding for their project “Cellulose Nanofibers Templated Metal-Organic Frameworks for Fluorescent-Visual Detection of Pesticides.” This research project aims to create a user-friendly detection platform using functionalized cellulose to monitor and control pesticide levels in the agricultural sector. The SFRA award is intended to help support student research/scholarship/creative activity; give students experience writing grants; and foster the mentoring relationship between faculty and graduate students.

### [Graduate student Kailong Zhang win Student Faculty Research Award](https://crc.tennessee.edu/asst-prof-mi-li-and-graduate-student-kailong-zhang-win-student-faculty-research-award/)
Dec 04, 2023
  
PhD student Kailong Zhang and Assistant Professor Mi Li at the Center for Renewable Carbon and the School of Natural Resources recently were awarded a Fall 2023 Student Faculty Research Award (SFRA). They will receive funding for their project “Cellulose Nanofibers Templated Metal-Organic Frameworks for Fluorescent-Visual Detection of Pesticides.” This research project aims to create a user-friendly detection platform using functionalized cellulose to monitor and control pesticide levels in the agricultural sector. The SFRA award is intended to help support student research/scholarship/creative activity; give students experience writing grants; and foster the mentoring relationship between faculty and graduate students. Congratulations!
